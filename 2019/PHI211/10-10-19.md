### What is piety?
1. Piety = what I am doing now
   1. Problem: this is not a definition
2. Piety = what the gods love
   1. Problem: how can we know?
   2. Problem: gods often disagree
3. Piety = what **all** the gods love
   1. Problem: how to interpret this
      1. Is the pious loved by gods because it is pious?
      2. Is it pious because it is loved?
4. Piety = part of justice
   1. Problem: which part?
