How can we find X if we don't know X?  
Can't start  
Can't end

We actually do know X

### Why is this a problem?
- no learning
- no point in trying

### Soc's answer/solution:
- soul is eternal
  - cycle of reincarnation
- soul has seen "all things"
- learning is recollection
  - soul **already** has knowledge
  - we must "bring forth" that knowledge

Education is a **turning** of the soul
