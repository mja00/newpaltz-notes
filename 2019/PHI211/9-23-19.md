## Parmenides
- First philosipher to do metaphysics in Greece
- monism - the idea that is only one existing thing
- 

### 11.1
- Goddess will reveal truth + falsity
  - mortal opinion

### 11.2
The 3 routes of inquiry - ways of investigating the world

1. The Path of Truth
   1. **is** and it is **not** the case that **is not**
2. Path (unnamed)
   1. **is not** and is not is **right**(wrong)
   2. Investigation of non-beings(things that don't exist)
3. Path of Mortal Opinion
   1. both **is** and **is not**(wrong)

You cannot **know** "what is not"(what does not exist)  
You cannot **declare** "what is not"  
Impossible to think about **nothing**

language <-> thinking <-> being  
Words are finite, limited, misleading, deceiving

### 11.8

The universe: its characteristics  
- ungenerated
  - no birth, no creation
- imperishable
- timeless, eternal
  - cannot say: was, will be, now, later, used to be
- changeless
- no motion
- uniform, continuous, whole, no gaps
