"In the beginning, god created light"

- Creation of heavens, earth, humans
    - Ea created mankind ln. 33
    - Ln. 3 Apsu was the first god created therefore establishing the first god.
    - Ln. 4 Tiamat was then created in which all the other gods were then birthed from
    - Ln. 131-141 Heavens were created from Tiamat's corpse being stretched into the heavens.
    - Ln. 49-62 Bel used the other half of Tiamat's corpse to make Earth. Her eyes becoming the Tigris and Euphrates. Her body was twisted into what the Earth is currently.

Tiamat gets angry at her children(the other gods) which annoys Apsu who then wants to kill the children. Ea then kills Apsu before Apsu can do it. Later on... Tiamat is even angrier and seeks to kill the younger gods (Qingu helps her). Marduk leads resistance. Marduk kills Tiamat and cuts her. One half becomes heaven, constellations, and time. Earth is then created from Tiamat's other half. Her eyes are becoming two different rivers. Marduk turns Tiamat's boobs into mountains. Humans are made from the broken blood vessels of Qingu and the blood is then what the humans are made from.
