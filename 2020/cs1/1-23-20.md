# CS1 Day One

### Starting a program
- Start with a class
- Name the class with a descriptive name
- Recommended for labs to name each class Q#.java
- No extra "." or spaces
- Save all files as a .java
- Create a ```public static void main(String[] args)```
- Variable types need to be capitalized

### Common functions
- ```System.out.print("");``` Prints to console
- ```System.out.println("");``` Prints to console with a \n at the end automatically


### Compiling a file
- Navigate to where the .java file is
- Run javac pointed at the .java file
- A .class is created

### Running a file
- Run java pointed at the class


### BlueJ
- An actual piece of shit IDE


## Examples from class

```java
class Examples {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("5 + 2 = " + (5 + 2));
        System.out.println(5-4*7+1);
        System.out.println((5-4)*7+1);
    }
}
```
